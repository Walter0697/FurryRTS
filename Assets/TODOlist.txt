TODO first:
- set up parent classes, then set up prefab for bunny
- collision detection for bunny and terrain
- set a building 
- building constantly generating bunny

Project prototype

- 3d rendering based on isometric view. Shaders
- Terrain and Units
- Collision detection between objects, between objects and terrain
- few instances of each type of units already created
- interaction (user click < border around the units when clicked? google it up/ just use an arrow to point at that / or just use shaders to do that stuff)
- Camera movemnt (camera tracking / mouse moving camera (for me i will take reference as Lol))
- enemy ai, just fucking walk
