# FURRY RTS

- Most of the technical requirements were described in previous README.md

- Pathfinding: A raycasting based pathfinding was implemented, which allows units to steer out of the way of buildings and other units to move to allow better movement.
- Semi-automatic actions: After crafting the unit will go back to the storage, units will attack enemies when nearby.
- Enemy AI: enemy will randomly find resources to craft, and select buildings to build. If they have enough resources, they will start attacking the opponent team.
- Full game mechanics: End game text will be shown when one building health becomes zero
- Feedback to the player: GUI was implemented to show the main building health and the resources a team owns
